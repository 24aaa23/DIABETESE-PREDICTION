# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various health metrics using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome).

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). It includes the following features:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age**: Age (years)
- **Outcome**: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating the presence of diabetes
